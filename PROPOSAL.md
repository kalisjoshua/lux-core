## Description

Lux-UI (Lux) is an application framework for a UI, backed by a hypermedia API.
Lux is responsible for interpreting API responses and translating the available
resources into a consistent UI. Generic page components provide a solid base
for most needs of applications while the framework allows the ability for
implementors to supply custom, pluggable, extensions for domain-specific needs.
The Lux framework is completely agnostic to, and largely ignorant of, business
use-cases and makes no assumptions about API structure or organization through
the reliance on - Siren - hypermedia.

The problem domain that Luxui is attempting to fill are:

  1. Creating a reason for our APIs to become standardized in response format.
  2. Enable non-UI developers to spend as little time in building UIs as
  possible.
  3. Enabling UI developers to have control over a wider selection of
  applications by building within a framework rather than single-use UIs.
  4. Working towards a consistent UX across many internal applications.
    - New Team Members and those moving between projects will have a consistent
    on-boarding experience that can be documented and learned.
  5. Create a mechanism to "rollout" interesting, helpful, and necessary
  updates to internal applications in a more consistent, scheduled, repeatable,
  and safe fashion.

Open sourcing the project will:

  1. Put QL into a community - the API community - in a new way and in a way
  that is solving a problem that the community needs help with.
  2. Show that QL is creating innovative work that is meaningful and necessary.
  3. Open up development to contributions from the external community
  4. Help the evolution of the idea and implementation.
  5. Garner feedback from people who are also interested in the
  problem/technology domain.
