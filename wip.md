Work in progress
================

  - [x] unit testing
  - [x] compile (build) on install
  - [ ] incorporate Redux for ALL state
  - [ ] migrate POC code-base in
    + [ ] only require use-land code to implement custom route handlers not
    Lux-defined route-handlers

## Maybe

  - [ ] compare output from: webpack, and rollup
  - [ ] move ReactDOM.render() into user-land code
