lux UI Roadmap
==============

  1. [ ] Open Sourced - available on public GitHub as a project usable by people
      outside of QL
  2. [ ] Reused - in production (or planned on being deployed to production) by
      another project than Phony
  3. [ ] Modular - core library will render a simple page but most other
      functionality is "Plugged in" (configured per application)
  4. [ ] Consumed - Phony refactored to consume lux as an external dependency
  5. [ ] Stand-alone - decoupled from Phony and reusable
